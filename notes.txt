Eager Rebalance -

All Consumers stop, give up their memberships of partitions.
They rejoin the consumer group & get a new partition.
During a short period of time, the entire consumer group stops processings.
Consumers don't necessarily get back the same partitions as they used to.
This is known as "Stop the world Event".

Cooperative Rebalance(Incremental rebalance) -

Reassigning a small subset of the partitions from one consumer to another.
Other consumers that don't have reassigned partitions can still process uninterrupted.
Can go through several iterations to find a stable assignment (hence "incremental").
Avoids "stop-the-world" events where all consumers stop processing data.
